```swift
func checkingFlatMap() {
    let ram = Student(score: BehaviorSubject<Int>(value: 80))
    let shyam = Student(score: BehaviorSubject<Int>(value: 100))

    let currentStudent = PublishSubject<Student>()

        currentStudent
            .flatMap({$0.score})
            .subscribe { score in
                print("Scroe == \(score)")
            } onError: { error in
                print("error == \(error)")
            }
           .disposed(by: dispose)

        currentStudent.onNext(ram)

        ram.score.onNext(90)

        currentStudent.onNext(shyam)

        shyam.score.onNext(110)

        shyam.score.onError(APIError.noData)

        ram.score.onNext(95) // its still there even we have started with shyam that is problem or not expected with flat map so will use latest flat map to avoid this.
    }

```


## FlatMapLatest

it will not listen prev subrcibed observer as you can see for 3 and 5
